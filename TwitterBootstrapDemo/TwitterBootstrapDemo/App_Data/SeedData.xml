        <![CDATA[This website contains a small subset of the articles I have written over the years. 
        
Over time I guess I will expand apon this to include all the articles I have written. 

By exploring the various tabs you should be able to find a range of stuff that I have worked on from WPF/SQL/NoSQL to WCF/SignalR/ASP MVC/Angular.js/Google earth/D3.js. 

I do try and keep my toe in with the web, though those that know me probably think of me as a desktop WPF kind of guy, that's about right. Though I quite enjoy doing stuff around the web. I will be taking some time off soon to learn a few things, namely F#/Azure/Amazon Web Services and PowerShell (though WebGL and Three.js look very nice), so once I have done that I may some more articles to add in here

For the UI we tend to use WPF for desktop applications and for web we have used a mixtre of ASP MVC / SignalR / Angular.js / Knockout.js / Backbone.js and Twitter Bootstrap.js. This section shows a few of the articles I have produced over the years]]>

      <title>Silverlight</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[I have always been more of a WPF boy than a Sliverlight inclined chappy. I have done a few Silverlight articles, but these were all really around the time of Silverlight 1.0 (the pure Javascript version) and 1.1 where you did have C# but still had to create your own UI elements. It was very basic. Silverlight was ok, but I prefer ASP MVC with a bit of MV** Javascript client side libraries really. That said I still think WPF is the richest UI framework of anything I have ever used, its awesome.

          <longDescription>
            <![CDATA[I wrote this article way back when Silverlight was in its infancy, and you still had to write your own controls. So I decided to write a sort of ScatterPanel type thing, which would allow you to scale/rotate and set Z-Index of items in the panel using the mouse. ALthough todays Silveright is a much improved version from the one this article uses, it is still an interesting article (I think) which shows you how to author custom conrols.]]>

        <![CDATA[This section shows some of the WinRT articles I have done. You may notice this is not many yet, as I don't think its ready enough to warrant any hard learning right now (Win8.1 just out at time of writing this), hopefully over time the APIs will improve, and become more attractive

          <longDescription>
            <![CDATA[This simply Windows8 (yes 8, not 8.1) was developed to showcase the awesome work Ian Johnsons StyleMVVM framework. It also tried to illustrate a few Win8 features, such as SearchContract/Camera. Some of these ideas presented in this article such as LayoutAwarePage, are now outdated with new Win8.1 classes, but it was started before Win8.1 was around. It still demonstrates a great MVVM framework (Style MVVM) that can be used with Win8.xx, so it should still be a very relevant article]]>
